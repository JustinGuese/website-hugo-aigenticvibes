you should always tell a story on the landing page, meaning always
1. short summary of the best features of the product
2. state the problem that exists, ideally with sources you researched in the internet
3. show the solution that the product is offering
4. show the result that people get from using the product

try to observe it from an emotional standpoint, speaking emotions, feelings, user stories, making this landing page feel personal.

@content/english/product/_index.md @themes/AIgenticVibes.com-hugo/layouts/product/index.html this is a hugo template. i want to make a reusable product landing page, recreating a nice sales funnel.

first, the header should show some slogan, and then in that a "ooops our pilot is full, but you can sign up for the next batch" email subscription box, with optional newsletter about saas news from us. we are AIgenticVibes.com, building a lot of cool SaaS products. you can use form POST to https://formspree.io/f/xkglrelp  with the email and checkbox==newsletter bool and hidden text field product=THISURL. the url will be the same between all landingpages.
next to that subscription box should be the "Fastlane Pilot Access" option, allowing users to get instant access to the current pilot batch, and a 1 year subscription for only 299€ (one-time). this is done by stripe with the link https://buy.stripe.com/test_8x2bJ29972ax28de81ak000  and additional url parameter ?product=THISURL.

next to that should be an optional youtube embedded video player (autostart). the youtube video url should be placeable in _index.md, if it is not set expect a banner_image variable, referring to an image. 

then, there should be a section talking about the problem, followed by a section of how this saas product solves it. 

after that the user can book a free live demo of how this works,

then, it should be followed up by reviews (already existing in the template)
