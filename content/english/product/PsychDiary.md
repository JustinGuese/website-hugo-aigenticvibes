# Science/Evidence Section
science:
  heading: "The Science Behind It"
  intro: |
    Every feature is built on peer-reviewed research. We don't guess what works—we implement what science has proven effective for mental health improvement.
  mechanisms:
    - title: "Increased Self-Awareness"
      description: |
        Writing in a happiness or gratitude journal helps people reflect on what's going well and how they feel, which raises self-awareness—a key factor in emotional regulation and well-being. Using a happiness diary 10 times correlated with an increase of ~0.14 points on a 0–10 happiness scale.
    - title: "Emotion Regulation"
      description: |
        Regular gratitude practice amplifies positive emotions (positive affect) and reduces negative emotions (stress, anxiety). Studies show measurable improvements in mood and stress levels. A 14-day study with 231 participants found that days with higher gratitude predicted lower stress the following day.
    - title: "Long-Term Benefits"
      description: |
        Even short interventions (2–3 weeks) show measurable benefits for mood, stress, and sometimes physical symptoms. The effects compound over time with consistent practice. Classic research shows participants who wrote about gratitude (vs. hassles) showed greater well-being, more optimism, better mood, and fewer physical complaints.
    - title: "Workplace Mental Health"
      description: |
        In professional contexts, gratitude journaling serves as a practical tool to boost well-being and reduce depressive symptoms, making it valuable for busy professionals. Systematic reviews show gratitude journaling reduces depressive symptoms and anxiety among workers while improving life satisfaction and positive affect.
  note: |
    **Important Note**: While gratitude and happiness diaries are beneficial, they are supportive tools, not replacements for therapy or clinical interventions when mental health issues are severe. PsychDiary complements professional care and can be a valuable addition to a comprehensive mental health strategy.
