# Science/Evidence Section
science:
  enable: true
  heading: "Science-backed, not just another wellness app"
  intro: |
    PsychDiary combines proven gratitude journaling techniques with modern AI. The goal: make it easy to reflect regularly and see which habits actually improve your well-being over time.
  mechanisms:
    - title: "Increased Self-Awareness"
      description: |
        Short, regular entries about what went well and what was difficult raise your self-awareness – a key factor in emotional regulation and well-being. Studies show that even simple happiness diaries lead to measurable, if small, improvements in self-reported happiness.
    - title: "Emotion Regulation"
      description: |
        Gratitude practice reliably amplifies positive emotions and reduces negative ones like stress and anxiety. In one 14‑day study, days with higher gratitude predicted lower stress the following day.
    - title: "Long-Term Benefits"
      description: |
        Even short interventions over 2–3 weeks show benefits for mood, stress and sometimes physical well-being. With consistent practice, these small gains compound over time.
  note: |
    **Important Note**: While gratitude and happiness diaries are beneficial, they are supportive tools, not replacements for therapy or clinical interventions when mental health issues are severe. PsychDiary complements professional care and can be a valuable addition to a comprehensive mental health strategy.

# Why Different Section
why_different:
  heading: "What makes PsychDiary different from other diary apps"
  intro: |
    PsychDiary stands out from generic notes apps and mood trackers through a combination of real AI analysis, privacy-first architecture in Germany, and a flow designed around scientific evidence – not guesswork.
  points:
    - title: "True AI Analysis, Not Just Keywords"
      description: |
        Most apps ask you to tap emojis or select predefined feelings. PsychDiary uses AI to read your full text and extract meaningful insights automatically – you write in your own words, the system does the analysis.
    - title: "Privacy-First Architecture"
      description: |
        **DSGVO compliant**, **data stored in Germany**, **pseudonymized entries** and clear controls over export and deletion. Your diary data is never sold and is processed only to provide the service.
    - title: "Real-Time AI Processing"
      description: |
        Entries are analyzed in real time. As you write, PsychDiary highlights happy moments, challenges and recurring themes so you immediately see what matters.
    - title: "Future-Ready: AI Psychologist Companion"
      description: |
        We are building towards a 24/7 AI psychologist companion that learns from your entries and supports you over time – with the same strict privacy standards.

# FAQ Section
faq:
  enable: true
  heading: "PsychDiary – Frequently Asked Questions"
  intro: "PsychDiary combines journaling with AI analysis while keeping your data private and under your control."
  items:
    - question: "Is PsychDiary a replacement for therapy?"
      answer: "No. PsychDiary is a supportive self-help tool, not a medical product and not a replacement for psychotherapy or psychiatric treatment. It can complement professional care, but it cannot provide diagnosis, crisis intervention or medical advice."
    - question: "How does the AI in PsychDiary work?"
      answer: "The AI analyzes your entries to detect patterns such as recurring emotions, situations that make you feel better or worse, and long-term trends in your mood. These insights are then summarized for you in simple language so you can better understand yourself."
    - question: "Is my data stored securely?"
      answer: "Yes. PsychDiary is designed with a privacy-first architecture: data is stored on servers located in Germany under strict DSGVO regulations, and access is technically limited to the systems that are required to provide the service."
    - question: "Who can see my entries?"
      answer: "Your diary is private by default. Entries are processed by the AI models, but no one in our team reads your texts for routine operation. We do not sell or share personal diary data with third parties."
    - question: "Can I export or delete my data?"
      answer: "You retain control over your data. You can export your entries for personal backup and request deletion of your account and associated data in line with DSGVO requirements."
    - question: "On which platforms is PsychDiary available?"
      answer: "PsychDiary is planned as a Web app as well as native apps for iOS and Android. Your entries synchronize across devices so you can write wherever it is most convenient."
    - question: "What makes PsychDiary different from a simple notes app?"
      answer: "Traditional diary apps store text, but they do not help you interpret it. PsychDiary uses AI to highlight what makes you feel good or stressed, show patterns over time and gently nudge you towards helpful habits such as gratitude."
    - question: "Is there a risk of over-automation by AI?"
      answer: "We deliberately design PsychDiary so that you remain in control. The AI provides insights and suggestions, but you decide what is meaningful for you. The focus is on reflection and self-awareness, not on automated decision-making."
    - question: "Can I use PsychDiary if I already see a therapist?"
      answer: "Yes. Many people use gratitude or mood journals as a complement to therapy. PsychDiary can help you capture situations and emotions between sessions so you can discuss them later with a professional if you wish."
    - question: "Who is PsychDiary for?"
      answer: "PsychDiary is for people who want to better understand their emotional patterns, build a gratitude habit and make mental health reflection part of everyday life – from busy professionals to students and anyone who likes structured self-reflection."
