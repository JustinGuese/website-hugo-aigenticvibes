# Science/Evidence Section
science:
  heading: "The Science Behind It"
  intro: |
    Every feature is built on peer-reviewed research. We don't guess what works—we implement what science has proven effective for mental health improvement.
  mechanisms:
    - title: "Increased Self-Awareness"
      description: |
        Writing in a happiness or gratitude journal helps people reflect on what's going well and how they feel, which raises self-awareness—a key factor in emotional regulation and well-being. Using a happiness diary 10 times correlated with an increase of ~0.14 points on a 0–10 happiness scale.
    - title: "Emotion Regulation"
      description: |
        Regular gratitude practice amplifies positive emotions (positive affect) and reduces negative emotions (stress, anxiety). Studies show measurable improvements in mood and stress levels. A 14-day study with 231 participants found that days with higher gratitude predicted lower stress the following day.
    - title: "Long-Term Benefits"
      description: |
        Even short interventions (2–3 weeks) show measurable benefits for mood, stress, and sometimes physical symptoms. The effects compound over time with consistent practice. Classic research shows participants who wrote about gratitude (vs. hassles) showed greater well-being, more optimism, better mood, and fewer physical complaints.
    - title: "Workplace Mental Health"
      description: |
        In professional contexts, gratitude journaling serves as a practical tool to boost well-being and reduce depressive symptoms, making it valuable for busy professionals. Systematic reviews show gratitude journaling reduces depressive symptoms and anxiety among workers while improving life satisfaction and positive affect.
  note: |
    **Important Note**: While gratitude and happiness diaries are beneficial, they are supportive tools, not replacements for therapy or clinical interventions when mental health issues are severe. PsychDiary complements professional care and can be a valuable addition to a comprehensive mental health strategy.

# FAQ Section
faq:
  enable: true
  heading: "PsychDiary – Frequently Asked Questions"
  intro: "PsychDiary combines journaling with AI analysis while keeping your data private and under your control."
  items:
    - question: "Is PsychDiary a replacement for therapy?"
      answer: "No. PsychDiary is a supportive self-help tool, not a medical product and not a replacement for psychotherapy or psychiatric treatment. It can complement professional care, but it cannot provide diagnosis, crisis intervention or medical advice."
    - question: "How does the AI in PsychDiary work?"
      answer: "The AI analyzes your entries to detect patterns such as recurring emotions, situations that make you feel better or worse, and long-term trends in your mood. These insights are then summarized for you in simple language so you can better understand yourself."
    - question: "Is my data stored securely?"
      answer: "Yes. PsychDiary is designed with a privacy-first architecture: data is stored on servers located in Germany under strict DSGVO regulations, and access is technically limited to the systems that are required to provide the service."
    - question: "Who can see my entries?"
      answer: "Your diary is private by default. Entries are processed by the AI models, but no one in our team reads your texts for routine operation. We do not sell or share personal diary data with third parties."
    - question: "Can I export or delete my data?"
      answer: "You retain control over your data. You can export your entries for personal backup and request deletion of your account and associated data in line with DSGVO requirements."
    - question: "On which platforms is PsychDiary available?"
      answer: "PsychDiary is planned as a Web app as well as native apps for iOS and Android. Your entries synchronize across devices so you can write wherever it is most convenient."
    - question: "What makes PsychDiary different from a simple notes app?"
      answer: "Traditional diary apps store text, but they do not help you interpret it. PsychDiary uses AI to highlight what makes you feel good or stressed, show patterns over time and gently nudge you towards helpful habits such as gratitude."
    - question: "Is there a risk of over-automation by AI?"
      answer: "We deliberately design PsychDiary so that you remain in control. The AI provides insights and suggestions, but you decide what is meaningful for you. The focus is on reflection and self-awareness, not on automated decision-making."
    - question: "Can I use PsychDiary if I already see a therapist?"
      answer: "Yes. Many people use gratitude or mood journals as a complement to therapy. PsychDiary can help you capture situations and emotions between sessions so you can discuss them later with a professional if you wish."
    - question: "Who is PsychDiary for?"
      answer: "PsychDiary is for people who want to better understand their emotional patterns, build a gratitude habit and make mental health reflection part of everyday life – from busy professionals to students and anyone who likes structured self-reflection."
