  AIgenticVibes is the product brand of **DataFortress.cloud GmbH** – a German company specializing in data engineering, DevOps (Kubernetes, OS) and applied AI. For more than a decade, we have been building robust data platforms and AI solutions for enterprises like **VW, BMW, Porsche, HPE and Atruvia (Volksbank)**.

  Today we use this enterprise experience to build focused **Micro-SaaS products** for both **B2B and B2C**. Each product solves a very specific problem – from searching internal documents with AI to calming your inbox or supporting mental well-being – with a strong focus on **measurable results, data security and EU compliance**.

  -  title: Diversity
     description: |
       We work across **Big Data, Cloud/Kubernetes, AI/ML and product design**. This diversity of experience lets us connect dots: from bare-metal clusters to Trino, from open-source contributions like Google’s TimesFM to end-user Micro-SaaS.

       We don’t sell buzzwords. Whether it is VW’s sampling process, Atruvia’s data warehouse or a solo founder using DocumentChat, we measure success in **time saved, errors reduced and revenue created**.
