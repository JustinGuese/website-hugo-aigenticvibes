    - question: "Which integrations are available?"
      answer: "DocumentChat can be connected to Microsoft Teams, Slack, WhatsApp and other channels. Your team can ask questions directly where they already communicate instead of switching tools."
    - question: "How accurate are the answers?"
      answer: "Answers are generated strictly from your own documents and are always accompanied by source snippets and links. This reduces hallucinations and lets you quickly verify every statement in the original file."
    - question: "Who is DocumentChat for?"
      answer: "DocumentChat is ideal for knowledge-intensive teams such as consulting, IT, legal, customer support, sales enablement and internal documentation teams who lose hours each week searching for information."
